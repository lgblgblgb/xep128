This directory contains more-or-less random documentations, sources of
programs, etc I found and find useful to develop Xep128.

Some of the texts, programs are written by me, some of them are not!
There is no single copyright/etc on files in this directory, this
can mean anything ... unless the license is not stated inside the file
itself.

Makefile

  You can use command 'make' with UNIX-like OSes to compile the
  included test sources. This implies you have sjasm 0.42c
  installed. Avoid 'make test' as it would use paths private
  to my own system!

exos10ts.asm

  EXOS 10 "file handler" function tests for the FILE: implementation.

intfreq.asm

  A test program used to messure B4 port level width on different
  interrupt sources in meaningless units :) Only can be used to
  compare the accuracy the emulation with a real EP or with a good
  emulator, like ep128emu.

irclet.asm

  A very primitive iRC "client" to test my w5300 emulation. Note:
  currently it's unknown if it works with a real w5300 though. Not
  even ready in Xep128 :) It's not a very comfortable iRC client,
  IP parameters are hard-wired (MAC address, IP, gateway, even
  iRC server IP address), and slow (EXOS functions used to print).
  It's simply not suitable for daily usage.

vinttest.asm

  Nick video interrupt test.

w5300-ep.md

  My own notes on w5300, focusing on the behaviour used by
  the furute (?) EP+w5300 project. It can be useful, as w5300
  specification is though nice, it's quite long, and some parts
  are not so much interesting for the first steps. Or even for
  further steps ...

z180test.asm

  z180test is a quirky Z180 behaviour tester written by me for
  Enteprise-128 equipped with Z180 CPU instead of Z80. It's used
  to test the result on my emulator and compared with a real
  EP/Z180 (thanks, Zozo!).

z80-emulated-cpu-speed-test.c

  A lame little (native, not Z80) program which links to z80ex.
  It tries to messure the speed of Z80 emulation.
