Official wiznet specification: http://www.mct.de/download/wiznet/w5300.pdf

Nothing is wrong about the specification, but it's quite long,
and I would like focus on the project now, not about w5300
in general, touching all aspects.

## The Wiznet w5300

w5300 is a "hardware TCP/IP chip" used to connect low-power
MCUs etc (which does not want - or cannot - implement a TCP/IP
stack by its own) to the Ethernet network. That is, compared
with other products like Microchip's ENC28J60, it also does
the bulk of the TCP/IP protocol, not just dealing with ethernet
frames (but you can use w5300 in raw mode, when you implement
your own TCP/IP implementation if you need this). w5300 has
some kind of embedded MCU (?) but it's "hidden" for us. w5300
has even 128K on-board memory, but it's cannot be accessed
directly from outside only through "FIFO registers". w5300
knows about direct and indirect mode, with 8 or 16 bit wide
data bus mode.

w5300 supports 8 concurrent connections called "sockets".
Each of these sockets have didicated I/O ports to control,
query etc the connection state, and so on.

## Emulation in Xep128

The Xep128 emulation of w5300 is VERY limited. I didn't want
to implement TCP/IP by my own so I use the host OS (the OS
which runs the Xep128 emulator, ie Linux or Windows for example)
does the TCP/IP. This cause many limitations though:

+ raw mode is not supported, only TCP or UDP sockets
+ ICMP is also not supported, it can require additional
  privilege from the applicaton (Xep128, I mean) on the host OS
+ local ports cannot be used as-is, as it can collide with
  ports used by the host OS, thus Xep128 does not pass the real
  local ports specified by w5300 settings
+ IP settings are ignored for real, as the host OS uses its
  own IP settings already!
+ things like timeouts, restransmittion, keep-alive etc
  are not used as dictated by w5300 settings at all
+ listening sockets are not implemented currently! it can
  be done (but for example it can collide with host OS ports,
  and also some OSes have limitation on usuable listing ports
  because of security reasons, eg UNIX-like OSes does not allow
  user programs to listen on ports below 1024).
+ MAC address is not used set by w5300 of course
+ PPPoE is not supported at all

So, under Xep128 emulation an EP software would work which
does not even set IP/MAC config up. But note; it would NOT
work on the real hardware!

Other limitations:

+ Direct access is not supported only indirect (but it also true for the hw project)
+ 8 bit bus mode is supported, 16 bit is not (but it also true for the hw project)
+ memory management of w5300 is not emulated

## Specification

Enterprise-128 + WizNet w5300 project ("the project" from now)
uses w5300 in indirect access mode with 8 bit data bus.
The specification itself contain nice draft-like schematics on
the hardware side.

Bus width mode is set "by hardware" (ie via a pin of w5300) and
it cannot be changed.

Indirect access mode requires 6 I/O ports. For the address
decoding most of us would treat as 8 I/O ports then though.
Note: indirect/direct access mode can be set via software.
So, one of the first things to set this, see RESET.

W5300 registers are 16 bit wide, and mainly optimized for
16 bit usage and I/O. But you can use it in 8 bit mode. Care
must be taken, as w5300 byte order IS THE OPPOSITE OF the one
used by Z80 or by x86 CPUs for example. The byte order - in
theory - can be configured, but it's mostly for 16 bit bus
mode, and according the specification "it is not valid" in
8 bit bus mode. So for I/O ports, usually the first byte
is the HIGH byte, and the second one is the LOW. Usually a
register name like "MR" is often named as "MR0" which is
actually the HIGH byte of MR, and "MR1", which is the LOW byte.
And as I've written, MR0 is at first (HIGH byte).

Both direct and indirect access mode implies having the
MR register at the IO BASE (where w5300 is decoded too). Since
direct/indirect access mode is software configurable, and MR
register is "always there", it cannot be a problem.

### RESET

w5300 does not have power-on-RESET at all, thus, a RESET
signal must be fed. Or you can use software initiated RESET.

(For I/O map and MR, see the next chapter)

Bit7 of MR1 can be set to '1' which causes w5300 to reset.
It will clear the bit, so maybe you should wait for that even,
that reset is completed. If you want to handle the situation
where no w5300 really exists, it can be a good idea to use
some kind of timing out strategy so your wait for reset task
won't stuck then forever. After reset, the firt thing you
want is to set indirect access mode, to be able to access
other registers than MR (see next chapter about the indirect
access).

So basically, you may want the following RESET strategy:

* Set RESET bit (bit7 of MR1)
* Wait for RESET bit cleared (bit7 of MR1), probably using a timeout value for error handling
* if OK: Set indirect bit (and possibly others if you need)
  bit0 of MR1 should be set for indirect mode

Optinally you can read 16 bit mode selection (read-only bit)
but probably you can't event reset w5300 via software if it's
wrong, as it's a hardware-level setting.

Waiting for reset bit clear is a rudimentary w5300 detection
as simply having something (or the stray bus) producing always
0 at postition of bit 7 will casuse to think as "successfully"
reset. So the next thing you should do is really test if w5300
presents, but even for that reset and indirect mode setting must
be done first.

Note: it seems Wiznet's AVR demo sources use the method to
wait 5msecs after reset. I am not sure if only reset bit clear by
w5300 is OK to check then. Maybe the best method is to
combine these: require reset, then wait for at least 5msecs
_then_ checking reset bit was clear (and maybe polling further
for some time, but with timeout ...). I guess, it must be
quite safe then to follow official information.

Optionally: you can skip the check reset bit is clear part but
wait at least 5msec. Detecting w5300 will surely tell if w5300
does not respond, see chapter "Detecting" later.

Note: be careful with MR. There are settings in it, ie leave
data on bus for longer time, etc. This can cause even hardware
damage, if bus collision is caused by a settings like this!

Register MR is at page 45 of the documentation.

### INDIRECT ACCESS and I/O map on EP

So, the I/O ports in indirect + 8 bit mode, from the view pont of
EP (IOB is the IO base, so the beginning of the I/O port range where w5300 is
decoded on EP to):

* IOB+0	MR0, _HIGH_ byte of MR
* IOB+1	MR1, _LOW_ byte of MR
* IOB+2	IDM_AR0, _HIGH_ byte of IDM_AR
* IOB+3	IDM_AR1, _LOW_ byte of IDM_AR
* IOB+4	IDM_DR0, _HIGH_ byte of IDM_DR
* IOB+5	IDM_DR1, _LOW_ byte of IDM_DR

Accessing MR is "direct", but any other register needs indirect
access in this mode, by sepcifying the register number in IDM_AR
to be set, and then read or write the data (IDM_DR register).

Register numbers set in IDM_AR should have lowest bit CLEAR all
the time (actually it is IGNORED by w5300). This is because
w5300 basically a 16 bit system. Thus, if you want to access
register "5", the method should be set IDM_AR to 4 (!). Then
IDM_DR0 would mean read/write address "4" and IDM_DR1 is about
address "5", so you are interested in IDM_DR1 part of IDM_DR.
If you want to access register 4, you still need to set IDM_AR
to 4, but then IDM_DR0 is register address "4" for reading/writing.

Setting "IDM_AR to 4" means - of course - setting IDM_AR0 to
0 (high byte of 4) and IDM_AR1 to 4 (low byte of 4).

Official documentation: page 21, page 48


### HEADACHES

There are several points where I don't see the exact behaviour
clearly. Maybe this is only my lazyness to read that specification
more carefully (RTFM ...) though. Let's see:

w5300 is basically seems to be word (16 bit) organized even
in 8 bit mode. The specification brings example for 8 bit mode
and it always says to set REG (16 bit) as set REG0 first
(high byte of REG) and then REG1 (low byte of REG). However
what's happen if you only do with REG0 or REG1?

As I can imagine, in 8 bit mode there is a latch in w5300
which is filled on reading, thus then you can read high
or low bytes of the value. But I can't be sure it works
this way. For writing this is even more complex issue:
can a 16 bit ingernal register written with only a half?
Specification examples do this setting REG0 first then
REG1. What happens if I only write one of them?

This is even a question for MR, which is not an indirect access
register.

Also for IDM_AR, can I set the address with only a byte, since - let's
say - the previous high byte is the same? Another
question: can I read/write IDM_DR without re-setting the IDM_AR
since the same register is used? I guess, yes, but I can't be
sure.

To overcome these problems, currently I always set address in
IDM_AR for both of bytes, then always read or write IDM_DR
in the IDM_DR0 then IDM_DR1 order. However, for performance
reasons, it's not so ideal for future network capable
softwares written for EP.

About writing only "half" of a (16 bit wide) register: it seems
even the specification has examples to do this. But please note
that some registers (SOCKET FIFO registers) have _very strict_
rules to be accessed, or RX/TX buffer access will result in
corrupted data! Even the order of accessing REG0 and REG1 is
strict in this case!

### IOB: IO BASE

Of course you must to know where  I/O ports for MR, IDM_AR
and IDM_DR is assigned to your Enterprise. In Xep128 emulator
of mine it is fixed from port 0x90. However Bruce told
me that his hardware project won't use a fixed address,
thus you can:

+ scan EP _memory_ segments for a ROM signature, and I/O
  base will be the _half_ of the ROM segment number.
  Though we don't know the signature yet we have to find :(
+ maybe later some kind of EXOS functionality will be
  provided to simply ask the address from the OS (EXOS),
  suggested by myself.

If there is a real hardware Xep128 will be modified to
use a similar scheme and not a fixed I/O base, of course.
Currently, Xep128 does not contain any EXOS_ROM just
the "bare hardware". Ideally, the ROM should know how
to set up IP, MAC, initialize/detect/reset w5300 etc,
so you can treat w5300 as initialized with the proper
settings, and not every software written for this project
need to set it up as its own.

So, currently with Xep128 (but it will be differnt with
the real hardware), the I/O ports are (IOB = IO base = 0x90):

* 0x90 MR0, _HIGH_ byte of MR
* 0x91 MR1, _LOW_ byte of MR
* 0x92 IDM_AR0, _HIGH_ byte of IDM_AR
* 0x93 IDM_AR1, _LOW_ byte of IDM_AR
* 0x94 IDM_DR0, _HIGH_ byte of IDM_DR
* 0x95 IDM_DR1, _LOW_ byte of IDM_DR

### DETECTING

W5300 has the IDR register, which can be used to identify
the w5300 really exists. Since the IDR register itself
cannot be accessed directly in indirect mode (of course),
detection can't be the first, you should try to reset
w5300 first and put into indirect mode, otherwise you may
not find it at all, since w5300 can be in direct mode
which is not supported then by the hardware configuration
used in our project.

IDR should be read as 0x5300 if w5300 presents in the system.
IDR register is at 0xFE. So you need:

* set IDM_AR to 0xFE, thus IDM_AR0 to zero, and IDM_AR1 is to 0xFE
* read IDM_DR, thus reading IDM_DR0 and IDM_DR1
  IDM_DR should be 0x5300, thus IDM_DR0=0x53 and IDM_DR1=0x00
  any other value means no w5300, bad hardware, or not
  configured indirect mode, etc etc.

By specification the next step should be set up interrupts
if needed at all (?). The suggested initialization process
is described from page 87 of the specification.

### BASIC IP/NET SETUP

Setting IP related configuration is probably the first
thing you want to do after reset and detection. In any case,
you can further improve your detection by checking all the
written values with reading back. It's not needed by
specification or such, just I do it for being sure and
discover possible bugs in software and/or hardware anyway.
In production it even makes the software slower!

w5300 supports PPPoE (PPP over ethernet). I don't need
this one, maybe you need it if you want to put your EP
onto ADSL (if it uses PPPoE) directly without a router, or such? What
I want to use is "simple" ethernet LAN solution, where
"internet" can be accessed via the default gateway, which
is some kind of router.

w5300 does not have pre-set MAC address, you need to set it
after reset. MAC addresses should be word-wide unique so
care must be taken, also if you write software with a given
MAC address hard-wired, you may have problem when you have
an Enterprise-128 party :) with more machines with the same
software as colliding MAC addresses. Ideally, if EP has
ROM for the project it should be done with different ROM
images for all ROMs produced to have different MACs. Or use
a config file from disk, or NVRAM in the system (eg the
RTC chip project). Also good to have static IP config.
A MAC address space should be used not to collide with
other ethernet products!

After setting MAC address up, you need to configure the
IP (IPv4) address of the default gateway (ie the "router"),
the network subnet mask (that is 255.255.255.0 for /24 for
example) and our own IP address will be used. Note: it
would be great to use DHCP, so EP can ask these settings
(of course, the MAC address cannot be asked, that is something
you need to take care about!), at least if you have DHCP
server (the router itself, probably, in a home network).
Decent software may need to allow user to set "static IP"
or DHCP (when you need to contruct DHCP request, to have
the IP settings you can use then).

MAC address can be set via the "SHAR" registers, 
from SHAR0 ... SHAR5 (6 bytes) from register address
8, that is set IDM_AR0 to zero (high byte of 8) and
IDM_AR1 to 8 (low byte of 8).

Thus, in indirect mode, you need to set address 8,
then use IDM_DR0 to set the first byte of the MAC address,
and IDM_DR1 to set the second byte. Then you need to
set address 10 (yes, after 8, the next register is at
address 10, since registers are 16 bit wide!), and use
IDM_DR0 to set third, and IDM_DR1 to set fourth byte of
MAC. And so on. You can see the idea, that w5300 is
basically 16 bit oriented stuff even in 8 bit mode.

IP related config is similar, but it's only 4 bytes,
but the process is basically the same.

From register address 0x10 you need to set the
gateway IP address ("GAR"), from 0x14 the subnet mask
("SUBR"), and from 0x18 the source IP ("SIPR") which
is "our IP address" basically.

The next step here should be setting up RTR and RCR
registers (retansmission time period, and retry
count). However I _think_ the default values set by
reset should be OK for the first steps. About RTR
and RCR see page 54 or the specification.

Note: if EP software does not use interrupts, it's
always good idea _NOT TO_ enable them with w5300
registers! Though Xep128 may not emulate interrupts
from w5300, the real hardware may does, thus
causing crashes etc if the EP software does not
handle the interrupts then!

### MEMORY MANAGEMENT

w5300 has its own 128K of memory. For each sockets
you can configure how much RX (receiving) and TX
(transmitting) buffer is assigned from this memory
space. Honestly, till now, I don't care about too
much on this. The default setting after reset seems
to be OK for the first steps (8K for every sockets
for both of TX and RX).

W5300's internal 128K memory is divided into 16
blocks of 8K memory. This can be divided into
RX and TX "type" of memory. Each sockets then
can "allocate" TX/RX memory in 1K steps having
0 - 64Kbyte of RAM. Or something like this, well :)

Note: w5300's memory is used to receive and transmit
packets. EP can't access RX/TX buffers directly like
normal memory (not even direct mode, but we use
indirect mode anyway), but through the socket's
FIFO (First-In, First-Out) registers.

### Ping it!

According to the specification, after the reset,
basic mode (indirect mode), IP/MAC and memory
setup w5300 will answer (on the ethernet network, from
other hosts, I mean) to ICMP echo requests
with ICMP replies (thus: "ping") automatically,
without any processing from the EP. Well, if it's
enabled, since ICMP echo auto processing can be
disabled. Since it seems it does not require EP
support, I think it's a good idea not to disable
this feature, as you can check on the network if
everything is OK with the intialization.

### SOCKET / COMMON registers

Registers between 0 ... 0xFF are called "common
registers", like with SHAR to set MAC address, etc.

In range of 0xFF ... 0x1FF there is an "unused gap" in
the register map, it seems.

In range of 0x200 ... 0x3FF you can find the "SOCKET
registers", 0x40 bytes for each of the 8 sockets.

0x3FF is the last register in the w5300 register map.

That is:

    0x0 - 0xFF:	COMMON registers, like SHAR (note: addressed 0-1 are unused!)
    0x100-0x1FF:	UNUSED
    0x200-0x3FF:	SOCKET registers:
    		0x200 - 0x23F	SOCKET0 registers
    		0x240 - 0x27F	SOCKET1 registers
    		0x280 - 0x2BF	SOCKET2 registers
    		0x2C0 - 0x2FF	SOCKET3 registers
    		0x300 - 0x33F	SOCKET4 registers
    		0x340 - 0x37F	SOCKET5 registers
    		0x380 - 0x3BF	SOCKET6 registers
    		0x3C0 - 0x3FF	SOCKET7 registers

For common registers we used some like SHAR, there are
more, with different feature, even like interrupt control
(w5300 can notify the host with an interrupt so it does
not need to polling). This feature is currently _not_
implemented by Xep128 at all!

### SOCKET registers

As we have 8 range of 0x40 wide register area for each
of the 8 sockets, we need only talk about a single one,
let's say SOCKET0. Of course the same (with adjusted addresses
of course) would apply for other sockets as well.

Generally socket register names like this: S0_MR

... which means socket0's MR. Of course it's two bytes in 8 bit mode, ie:
S0_MR0 and S0_MR1

Do not be confused, S1_MR0 is the first (high) byte of MR for
S1 (socket1) where S0_MR1 is the second (low) byte of MR for
S0 (socket0). And so on. Now only about socket0 (S0_SOMETHING) registers
which should be meant for other sockets as well with the
same layout (addr, 16 bit name, two 8 bit register names, high, low order):

* 0x200	S0_MR		S0_MR0	 S0_MR1		Mode register of socket
* 0x202	S0_CR		(S0_CR0) S0_CR1		Command register
* 0x204	S0_IMR		(S0_IMR0) S0_IMR1	Interrupt Mask register
* 0x206	S0_IR		(S0_IR0) S0_IR1		Interrupt register
* 0x208	S0_SSR		(S0_SSR0) S0_SSR1	Socket Status Register
* 0x20A	S0_PORTR	S0_PORTR0 S0_PORTR1	Source port register
* 0x20C	S0_DHAR		S0_DHAR0 S0_DHAR1	Destination hw (MAC) address
* 0x20E	S0_DHAR2	S0_DHAR2 S0_DHAR3	-- "" --
* 0x210	S0_SHAR4	S0_SHAR4 S0_SHAR5	-- "" --
* 

For sure (as written about) this table should be interpreted
with addresses from 0x240 and names S1_SOMETHING for socket1, and so on.
Register names in brackets means reserved register which is not used too
much (ie, 16 bits - word - organized w5300 uses only a 8 bit part of
that register).

Some items seem to odd: eg S0_DHAR2 is a 16 bit wide register
which can be imagines with two 8 bits registers by S0_DHAR2 (the same name
as for the whole register) and S0_DHAR3? It's just the problem
with naming (it seems in the official documentation as well). Probably
here at least the best you can think that S0_DHAR is actually a 6 byte
(3 word) long register, just it can be accessed by 3 words, that is 6
bytes. It's very similar to the SHAR COMMON register. Of course similar
issues can be seen with registers like this, requiring more than 1 word
(2 bytes), do not be confused because of this. Also, do not worry about
Sn_DHAR stuffs, you don't need to know the MAC address of the destination,
it can be used though in SEND_MAC mode, and maybe (?) it is also filled
by w5300, if you are interested to get to know.

Things like Sn_CR means eg S3_CR for n=3, a short way to tell that Sn_CR
for any socket's CR.

#### Command Register (Sn_CR)

Command Register (Sn_CR, though only Sn_CR1 part is used) is for specifying
a command (on the given socket). The specification says that command is
cleared (I think it means if you read back the register) even at the time
when command is still being processed, thus you need to check
Sn_IR or Sn_SSR to see the status, you _should not_ treat reading Sn_CR1 == 0
condition as command is ready.

Command register (at least part Sn_CR1) is a single 8 bit value specifying
a command to a given socket. In situations like this, with 8 bit data bus,
it sounds logical not to even read/write the CR0 as it's the reserved part.
